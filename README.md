# Vulkan Embassy

The objective of this project is to provide a saner interface to Vulkan in C++.
It's not meant to be a full high-level abstraction, but a way to to provide an equivalent 
API that's more in line with the language's standards. 

The current state of the project is essentially a drafting area to play with a potential API.
